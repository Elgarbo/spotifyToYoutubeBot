# Spotify To Discord Bot  â–¶
Discord bot that will convert playlist songs from Spotify to a Youtube songs playlist

## Prerequisites

* Python 3 (tested with v3.6.6, should work for 3.5+)
  * [Discord Python module](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/)

  * Admin permissions on Discord server
 
<b><i>IMPORTANT:</i> I use autoPep 8 formatter in this project.


# How does it work?
All you gotta do is insert your <b> >>PUBLIC<< </b> <a href="http://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> playlist URL when prompted, then the app will automatically search all songs from that playlist on <a href="http://youtube.com">YouTube</a> and return the URLs.

Check below for instructions on how to make it work.
